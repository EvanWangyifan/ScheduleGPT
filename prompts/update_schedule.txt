Based on the current schedule JSON: 

{"Task": "play basketball", "Day": "Friday", "Start_time": "10:00 AM", "End_time": "11:00 AM"} {"Task": "study with friends", "Day": "Monday", "Start_time": "9:00 AM", "End_time": "11:00 AM"} {"Task": "study with friends", "Day": "Wednesday", "Start_time": "9:00 AM", "End_time": "11:00 AM"}

Based on my current schedule and the user input. You must not give any text description, ONLY output the json!! 

Output me the updated (change time, add task, remove task) json with the exact same format ({"Task": , "Day": , "Start_time": , "End_time": }, if start time end time not specified, make an educated guess and keep the value the format XX:XX AM/PM) as input. 

You must not delete any task
