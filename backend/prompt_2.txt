Instructions & Requirements:
'''
1. The first piority to do is try to arrange time slot for task with specified time or weekday.
        - if it is not possible to put all time specified task on the described day, put it under the extra key.
2. For task that does not have a specific time or date, try to find spare time to avoild conflict with the specified tasks.
        - if no duration specified, use common sense to make educated guess. (2-3 hours for a movie, an hour for lunch, etc.).
        - if no start time or end time specified, use common sense to make the time reasonable. (eg. lunch during noon, dinner at night).
        - try to allocate these unspecified-time tasks evenly spread through out the week. Avoiding have everything scheduled on the first/second half of the week and nothing to do on the other half.
             (eg. all days have task in it except for Friday, allocate the task to Friday)
        - for repeating task (eg. workout 3 times a week),  try to evenly spread them to avoid do them on the same day or consecutive days.
        - allocate a 5-10 min break between task if possible (without violating the time specified) and no need to include break as task in the output json..
        - leave some free time for lunch everyday noon. 
3. You can assume everyday's tasks start from 9:00 and end before 21:00 unless specified.
4. Assign the tasks to the same/repeating task_id if they are the same, otherwise assign a unique task_id with positive number. 
5. If possible, try to allocate tasks evenly so that most of the day have some task instead of some days are overloaded some days are empty with plan.
